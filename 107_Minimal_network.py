'''An undirected network consists of seven vertices and twelve edges with a total weight of 243.

The same network can be represented by the matrix below.
        A  B  C  D  E  F  G
     A  -- 16 12 21 -- -- --
     B  16 -- -- 17 20 -- --
     C  12 -- -- 28 -- 31 --
     D  21 17 28 -- 18 19 23
     E  -- 20 -- 18 -- -- 11
     F  -- -- 31 19 -- -- 27
     G  -- -- -- 23 11 27 --
However, it is possible to optimise the network by removing some edges and still ensure that 
all points on the network remain connected. The network which achieves the maximum saving  has a weight of 93, 
representing a saving of 243 âˆ’ 93 = 150 from the original network.


Using network.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 6K text file containing a network with forty vertices, 
and given in matrix form, find the maximum saving which can be achieved by removing redundant edges whilst ensuring 
that the network remains connected.
