'''145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

Note: as 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.

'''As an aside, the amount of distinct combinations of the n = 10 digits (0-9), 
where we only have numbers of r length (so we're choosing r digits from the 0-9 pool, with repeats), 
can be calculated with the following formula:

(r + n - 1)! / r!(n - 1)!

For numbers of length 2 through 7, the following amount of combinations are created:
2: 55
3: 220
4: 715
5: 2002
6: 5005
7: 11440

We only have to go up to 7 digits, because the largest value an 8-digit number (99999999) can have its factorials sum 
up to is 2903040, meaning that all other possibilities will be less than that, and 8-digit numbers, by definition,
are ALL larger than that. This is only worsened as the number of digits increases, so it's impossible for any
numbers with more than 7 digits to have the sum of the factorials of their digits equal the original number.

The sum of all the combinations for numbers ranging in length from 2 digits to 7 digits is 19437, or

Î£ i = 2, 7 for (10 + i - 1)! / 10!(i - 1)!
