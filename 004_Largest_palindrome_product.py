'''A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the 
product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

'''Since the largest possible multiplication of 2 3-digit numbers (999 * 999) results in a 6-digit number,
we know that our palindrome will have 6 digits. Since a 6-digit palindrome must be of the following
form:

(100000 * a) + (10000 * b) + (1000 * c) + (100 * c) + (10 * b) + (1 * a)

which can be simplified as follows:

100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100c + 10b + 1a

100001a + 10010b + 1100c

11(9091a + 910b + 100c)

We know that our palindrome must be divisible by 11, which means at least one of our two factors must
be divisible by 11.

I use this fact to speed up our search significantly.'''
